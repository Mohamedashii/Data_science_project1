This project aims to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes information about each passenger, such as age, sex, ticket class, fare, number of family members aboard, cabin, and port of embarkation, with the target variable being “Survived” (1 for survived, 0 for not survived), making it a binary classification problem. The work typically begins with exploratory data analysis to understand the data, examine distributions, and study how survival rates vary by gender, class, and age groups. Next, the data is cleaned and preprocessed by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and creating useful new features like family size or titles extracted from names. After preprocessing, various classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting are trained to predict survival. Model performance is then evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices, often with a train–test split or cross-validation. Overall, the Titanic survival prediction project is a classic beginner-friendly task that helps learners practice essential skills in data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, and evaluating machine learning models.
